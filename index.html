          <p>
            In Bangladesh, for people who use drugs and who are already
            struggling with disenfranchisement from the wider community, the
            hardships they face in making a living and accessing social
            protection schemes have been exacerbated.

            JAAGO Foundation has started a fund to bring help to the
            unprivileged. The fund gathered over Tk4.5 lakh in only three days
            since its launch. A total of 155 people donated to the organization,
            showing the power of crowd-funding.
